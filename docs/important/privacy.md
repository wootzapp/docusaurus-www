## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Wootzapp Inc. ("Wootzapp", "we", "us", or "our"). Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share your personal information through our web browser and related services (collectively, the "Services"). By using our Services, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use our Services or opt in to any data sharing features.

For any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:

**Email:** webmaster@wootzapp.com  
**Address:** Delaware, USA

## 2. Information We Collect

### a. Information You Provide
- **Account & Profile Information:** When you create an account or update your profile, we collect details such as your name, email address, phone number, and other contact information.
- **KYC Data:** For regulatory compliance (e.g., KYC/AML for payouts), we may request identity verification (government-issued ID, proof of address, etc.).
- **Financial Information:** To facilitate cryptocurrency or fiat rewards, we collect payment details such as your crypto wallet address or banking information (processed via secure third-party services).

### b. Automatic Data Collection
Wootzapp automatically collects certain information to help us provide and improve our Services:
- **Usage & Diagnostic Data:** This includes device type, operating system, browser type, IP address, and log data (such as crash reports and error logs).
- **Analytics & Tracking Tools:** We use tools like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Segment, and similar services to track usage patterns and performance. These tools help us understand user behavior, troubleshoot issues, and improve our Services.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** If you log in via third-party providers (e.g., Google or Facebook), we collect the information provided (such as your name and email) for authentication and account setup.
  
### c. Crash and Error Reporting
We use crash reporting services to automatically collect diagnostic information (e.g., stack traces, device details, timestamps) when errors or crashes occur. This helps us rapidly fix issues and improve the overall stability of our Services.

### d. Cookies and Similar Technologies
We and our partners use cookies and similar tracking technologies to remember your preferences, authenticate you, and gather usage statistics. You can manage these settings via your browser, though disabling some cookies may limit certain functionalities.

### e. Children's Privacy (COPPA)
Wootzapp is **not intended for children under the age of 13**. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). If we discover that personal data from a child under 13 has been inadvertently collected, we will delete it promptly. Our Services are not directed at, nor should they be used by, anyone under 13.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use your information for purposes including, but not limited to:

- **Provision of Services:** Creating and managing your account, authenticating your access, and enabling features like data sharing and rewards.
- **Service Improvement:** Analyzing usage data (often aggregated or anonymized) to troubleshoot issues, enhance functionality, and develop new features.
- **Communication:** Sending important notices (e.g., security alerts, account updates) and, if you opt in, marketing communications.
- **Fraud Prevention & Security:** Monitoring for suspicious or fraudulent activity, protecting against theft, and complying with law enforcement requests when necessary.
- **Legal Compliance:** Meeting legal obligations such as KYC/AML, responding to lawful requests, and maintaining records for regulatory purposes.
- **AI Training & Research:** With your consent, we may use anonymized or aggregated data to improve AI models and related technologies.

## 4. How We Share Your Information

We share your information only under specific circumstances and with appropriate safeguards:

### a. With Third-Party Service Providers
We share data with trusted third-party providers (such as cloud services, analytics, payment processors, and crash reporting tools) who process data on our behalf under strict contractual terms.

### b. With Third-Party Partners (for AI & Data Solutions)
With your explicit consent, we may share your data—often in an aggregated or de-identified form—with partner companies in the AI and data analytics space. Such transfers may involve compensation and will be conducted in compliance with applicable data protection laws. Once your data is shared, it is subject to the partner's own privacy policies.

### c. Legal and Regulatory Disclosures
We may disclose your personal data if required to do so:
- **By Law:** In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes.
- **For Safety & Fraud Prevention:** To protect against fraud, theft, or other illegal activities, and to comply with requests from local law enforcement.
- **Business Transfers:** In connection with mergers, acquisitions, or asset sales, provided the recipient agrees to uphold the commitments set out in this Policy.

### d. International Data Transfers
Your personal data may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your own (including the United States). We ensure such transfers use legally recognized safeguards, such as:
- **Adequacy Decisions**
- **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)**
- **International Data Privacy Frameworks**

Your consent to this Policy covers these cross-border transfers necessary for data sharing, compensation, and business operations.

## 5. Your Rights and Choices

You have rights regarding your personal data. These may include:

- **Access & Portability:** Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
- **Correction:** Request updates to incorrect or incomplete data.
- **Deletion:** Request deletion of your data (note: data already shared with third parties may not be retroactively deleted).
- **Opt-Out:** Choose not to participate in our data sharing program or marketing communications. For California residents, you have a right under CCPA to opt out of the "sale" or "sharing" of your data.
- **Withdrawal of Consent:** You may withdraw your consent for data processing at any time (except where processing is required by law).

To exercise these rights, please adjust your settings in the Services or contact us at webmaster@wootzapp.com. We may require additional verification before processing your request.

## 6. Data Security

We implement a variety of security measures to protect your personal data:
- **Encryption:** Data is encrypted in transit (e.g., via TLS) and at rest where appropriate.
- **Access Controls:** Strict internal policies ensure that only authorized personnel access your data.
- **Regular Audits:** We conduct routine security audits and vulnerability assessments.
- **Anonymization:** When possible, we de-identify or aggregate data before sharing.

Despite these measures, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. You are encouraged to use secure passwords and promptly report any suspicious activity.

## 7. Compliance with Applicable Laws

We adhere to relevant data protection laws, including:
- **GDPR (EU)**
- **CCPA/CPRA (California, USA)**
- **COPPA (USA)**
- **Other applicable local laws (e.g., PDPL, PDPA)**

We also comply with requests from law enforcement and regulatory authorities whenever required by law, provided we can do so without compromising your privacy beyond what is legally permissible.
